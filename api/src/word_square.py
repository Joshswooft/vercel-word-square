'''
Solution is valid if the following conditions are met:
- length of words in list is equal to the size of the square
- For each row/column the word is the same

i.e. words=['rose', 'oven', 'send', 'ends'], square_size=4
    ROSE
    OVEN
    SEND
    ENDS

ROSE is in 1st column and 1st row
OVEN is in 2nd column and 2nd row...
